Version 3.1.1.0
---------------
* Handling quotes in filenames (GitHub issue #42)


Version 3.1.0.0
---------------
* Added support for async/await operations. This means the old event based async methods
  have been moved to "AsyncEvent()" and the moderne .NET async handling is now the
  result of using "Async()". If you are using "Async()" today then you need to rename all
  those method references to "AsyncEvent" instead to keep working with the event based async interface.
* Make error handling easier with Session.Decode<T>(WebException ex) (GitHub issue #38)
* Move Follow and Select extensions out of Hypermedia namespace (GitHub issue #36)
* Protect against stack overflows on circular references when serializing(GitHub issue #37).
* Avoid binding session as URL parameter (GitHub issue #37).
* Do not try to serialize indexer properties (GitHub issue #35)
* Avoid exceptions when comparing non-valid-media-type strings to MediaType instances (GitHub issue #39)


Version 3.0.0.0
---------------
* Added access to ResponseUri directly in Response class (GitHub issue #20).
* Added TrySelect() and Exists() to check for existence of links in link lists (GitHub issue #21).
* Added non-generic overload of Created() on Response (GitHub issue #23).
* Default media type fixed (GitHub issue #27)
  * Stream is now application/octet-stream.
  * Byte[] is now application/octet-stream.
  * String is new text/plain.
* Extended Bind() with overload for binding links (GitHub issue #28).
* Extended link Follow() with overloads to allow link selection too (GitHub issue #29).
* Include value of "expires_in" from OAuth2 access token (GitHub issue #30).
* Improving object serializer such that it may include null values (GitHub issue #31).
* Fixed missing handling of arrays and other enumerables in ContextRegistrator (GitHub issue #32).
* Fixed concurrency problems with connection statistics (GitHub issue #33).
* Updated to .NET frameork 4.6.
* Updated dependencies to latest versions.


Version 2.0.0.0
---------------
This release contains a few breaking changes:

- Ramone now uses NuGet to manage dependencies instead of merging them into the final assembly (Ramone.dll).
- There is no longer a Ramone.Core.dll as this has been replaced with Ramone.dll.
- For various reasons Ramone now uses JSON.NET instead of JSONFX for JSON serializations.

Complete changelist:

* Using JSON.NET instead of JSONFX for JSON (de)serialization.
* Using JOSE JWT for JWT generation instead of implementing them internally (GitHub issue #24).
* Now possible to specify target filename for file uploads (GitHub issue #11)
* Change JSON patch identifier to application/json-patch+json (GitHub issue #8)
* Make Session member public on Request object (GitHub issue #7)
* Do not include client_id in OAuth2 access token request when using HTTP Basic Auth (GitHub issue #14)
* Add support for Subject in OAuth2 authorization (GitHub issue #25)
* Enable anonymous sessions (GitHub issue #13)
* Make it possible to call BasicAuthentication(...) on Session more than once (GitHub issue #16)
* Add default codec for byte arrays (GitHub issue #15)


Version 1.3.1.79
----------------
* Make it possible to cancel async operations
* Adding StringFile and MemoryFile.
* Fix copy constructor to copy more properties


Version 1.3.0.75
----------------
* Bumping version number since I messed up and named the last NuGet package 1.2.056
  (should have been 1.2.0.56 - and now NuGet wont recognize 1.2.1.69 as a never version)


Version 1.2.1.69
----------------
* Fix issue #3: "Ramone.Core.dll does not work"


Version 1.2.1.68
----------------
* Introducing IRequestInterceptor2 which allows implementors to intercept the
  request at a time where it is possible to change the request method.
* Now possible to create services and sessions without a base URL. In this case
  it is only possible to make requests with absolute URLs.
* Remove byte order marks in output from text based formats (especially JSON).
* Fix issue #2: "Response.Body is re-reading input"


Version 1.2.0.56
----------------
* Introducing cache headers on Request object:
  Request.IfModifiedSince()
  Request.IfUnmodifiedSince()
  Request.IfMatch()
  Request.IfNoneMatch()
* Introducing .NET cache policy on Session and Service:
  Session.CachePolicy
  Service.CachePolicy
* Adding Request.OnHeadersReady() for working with the underlying 
  HttpWebRequest object.
* Adding Request.AddQueryParameters() as an alternative to binding with 
  predefined URL templates.
* Adding XML settings in XmlConfiguration.XmlReaderSettings. Used when
  deserializing XML documents. Default is to allow DTD processing.
